Ok, click that pencil button right above here (and a little to the right) so you can edit this file (if you're on GitHub.com).
Now that you've done that, when you're ready to see how this will actually look when you're done, click the Preview Changes tab (this won't work if you're on a local IDE, you'll just have to trust me or open this repository on GitHub.com).

# Now, how to write markdown

One # is for big stuff.

# See? Big stuff.

Two ## is for not quite as big stuff.

## Not quite as big.

Three ### is for slightly less big stuff.

### Less big.

(I think you get the point.)

Then you can just write like a regular person for normal text. Just make sure you leave a space after those #.

This is how you do hyperlinks, (and this will show you how to do everything else.)[https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/]
