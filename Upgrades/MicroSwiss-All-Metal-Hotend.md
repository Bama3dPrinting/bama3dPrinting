# MicroSwiss All Metal Hotend
### Nathan Eads
I bought the MicroSwiss for my Wanhao i3 clone planning to move to PETG exclusively over PLA, that still hasn't happened.
It certainly jams less than the stock plastic assembly, although when it does jam, it's almost always due to your temperature being too low. In order to keep the whole assembly at nominal temperature, you need to run ~10Â° than normal. Going too much colder and the filament gets stuck in the throat, going too much hotter causes your filament to glass.
Generally strong product.
