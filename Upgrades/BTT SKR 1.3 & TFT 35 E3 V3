# BigTreeTech SKR 1.3 & TFT 35 E3 V3
### Nathan Eads
After my E0 stepper died on my printer's stock mainboard, I replaced it with a SKR 1.3, TFT 35, and a set of 2209s. They worked like clockwork for the first few weeks until something went suddenly wrong. I still don't know if it was the SKR 1.3 or the TFT but they stopped detecting each other and I ended up having to replace both.
Other than that, they've been great. The SKR offers 32 bit printing and silent operation with the 2209s (seriously, my fans are the loudest thing on my printer, it's crazy).
