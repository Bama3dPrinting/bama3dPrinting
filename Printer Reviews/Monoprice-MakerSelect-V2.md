# MonoPrice MakerSelect V2
### Nathan Eads
I really loved my MakerSelect, it's more machine now than man (I had to do a full mainboard swap after the E0 stepper driver died). This was a really fantastic and cheap first printer.
One issue has to do with the powersupply which technically doesn't produce enough voltage to power both the heated bed and extruder (or something similar, I don't quite remember the exact issue). Anyway, the solution is a $10 mosfet and about 20 minutes of your time, which isn't too bad, but its an operation you should do on a new printer.
