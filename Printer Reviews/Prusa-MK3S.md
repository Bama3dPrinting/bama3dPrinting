# MK3S
### Nathan Eads
I was very lucky that I did not have to pay for my MK3S. I founded a company last summer and technically it belongs to that company and not to me. Nonetheless, I am the one who uses it.
This printer is straight up reliable. For most prints, I start the print and come back when its done. It's smart, it's fast, it's reliable.
This printer also uses the PrusaSlicer which compared to slow, clunky Cura, is a breath of fresh air. I almost never have to tweak settings beyond the default profiles. I expected the printer to be good, I did not, however, expect the slicer to be such a gamechanger.
Another great feature are the spring steel beds. I haven't had to pick or pull at a single print. You pull the bed off, bend it, and prints come off in your hand.
Nonetheless, even if you decide to get the kit, the MK3S is gonna burn a $750 hole in your pocket, compared to the Prusa Mini which has similar features at $350. I haven't used a Mini, but it seems like a strong competitor to the MK3S unless you really need that extra build volume.
