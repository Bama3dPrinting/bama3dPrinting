# The Cube Printing Process
### For Entry Level Printers (Dremels & Ultimaker)
Email theCube@ua.edu to schedule a time to be trained on 3DprinterOS. Once we train you, you can print remotely from the online 3DprinterOS client.

### For Industrial Printers
Go to [the Cube website](https://thecube.eng.ua.edu/) and fill out the Project Request form according to the printer you want to use.

## Regardless of which method you choose, your part will be reviewed. It cannot be from Thingiverse, it cannot violate copyright, and it cannot be a weapon or other offensive material.
