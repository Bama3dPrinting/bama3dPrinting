## Printers Currently Available for Student Use (Updated November, 2020)
### Dremel 3D45
The Dremels are solid printfarm printers. They are by no means stellar printers and produce only slightly better prints than what you might get off of an out of the box hobbyist printer, however they are able to do so with little to no maintenance.
Currently, we only have PLA stocked.
Most print jobs will go to these printers, unless they show a need for another printer.

### Ultimaker S5
We just got an Ultimaker S5, it has dual extrusion support and is currently running soluble support material in one extruder.

### Dimension 1200
This is a very expensive printer to run, it uses ABS and soluble support.

### MarkForged
This printer has Continuous Fiber Deposition; essentially, it uses a secondary extruder to inlay carbon fiber, kevlar, or other supported fibers into a nylon print to provide reinforcement.

### Form 3
It's resin. It prints small.

### Projet 2500
Also resin. More expensive. Prints small but in a bigger build volume.
